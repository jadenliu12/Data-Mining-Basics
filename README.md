# Data Mining Lab 1 - 108062182

This homework is divided into 4 different sections, where the first section will be using a dataset from sklearn and the other 3 section will be using a dataset from UCI's machine learning repository.  

## Datasets
- Sklearn's 20 News Groups - [Description here](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/)  
- Sentiment Labelled Sentences - [Description here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences#)  

## How To Run?
Language: Python 3+  
Recommended way of running: use the `jupyter notebook` command

## 1st Section
For the 1st section we are going to disect sklearn's 20 news groups by using these following methods:
- Data Preparation
- Data Transformation
- Data Mining using Pandas
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Exploration

## 2nd section
For the 2nd section we are going to disect sentiment labelled sentences by using these following methods:
- Data Preparation
- Data Transformation
- Data Mining using Pandas
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Exploration

## 3rd section
For the 3rd section we are going to do a little bit different from the first and second section. Here, we are going to generate different kinds of visualization in order to get more information regarding the second datasets.  

Furthermore, we are also going to use sklearn's TF-IDF vectorizer to generate new features, which will then be used to train a naive bayes classifier and compare it to sklearn's count vectorizer to see which feature can help the model classify the label better.

## 4th section
Lastly, in the 4th section, I will be explaining a little bit more on what is effective and what is ineffective based on the work that has been done in both the first and second section.
